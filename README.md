# Facebook-Weather-Bot
A Facebook messenger bot that uses natural language processing to give you the weather or forecast anywhere in the world! 


Project can be found by messaging "ParrotBot" on Facebook.

This was a project I built to learn the basics of how to create a facebook messenger bot. Used node.js and heroku for my webhook
and wit.ai (a natural language processing engine) for breaking down a user's query and a recognizing intent no matter how a user 
queries the bot. 

Special thanks to openweathermap.org for keeping their api open to the public for grabbing weather content at any second.
